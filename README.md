# UIUC CS598 final project on Oblivious Parallel RAM
> Yue Chen and Yuxuan Wu

### Abstract:
Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic primitive that allows a single client to access an untrusted server while concealing the access patterns, thereby providing stronger privacy guarantees. To go a step further, Oblivious Parallel RAM (OPRAM) introduces a primitive where multiple mutually trusted clients are accessing the same ORAM in a paralleled manner. This introductory project will focus on presenting the main ideas of 3 important OPRAMs that are introduced between 2015-2017. To do so, we will first outline two fundamental ORAMs schemes: Path ORAM and Tree ORAM, followed by the corresponding constructions and implementations of these 3 OPRAMs. In the end, we will briefly touch on some newer papers in the OPRAM field and some possible applications that may develop upon it.
